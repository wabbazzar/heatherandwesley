# RSVP Character Background Images - TODO

## Overview
Each character (Wesley, Heather, Puffy) has their own unique RSVP click-through experience with 4 steps. We need to add character-specific background images to make each experience visually distinct while maintaining uniformity in style and implementation.

## Current RSVP Flow Structure
Located in: `src/components/RSVPSection.tsx`

### 4 RSVP Steps for Each Character:
1. **Initial Form** - Basic info (name, email, phone, attendance)
2. **Diet Form** - Dietary restrictions and preferences  
3. **Song Form** - Music requests for the playlist
4. **Message Form** - Personal messages for the couple

## Task Requirements

### Background Image Implementation
- **4 unique background images per character** (12 total images)
- **Consistent styling approach** across all characters
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Maintains readability** of form content over background images

### Character-Specific Images Needed

#### Heather (Elegant/Romantic Theme)
- [ ] `heather1.png` - Initial Form background ✅ (provided)
- [ ] `heather2.png` - Diet Form background 
- [ ] `heather3.png` - Song Form background
- [ ] `heather4.png` - Message Form background

#### Wesley (Adventure/Quest Theme)  
- [ ] `wesley1.png` - Initial Form background
- [ ] `wesley2.png` - Diet Form background
- [ ] `wesley3.png` - Song Form background 
- [ ] `wesley4.png` - Message Form background

#### Puffy (Playful/Fun Theme)
- [ ] `puffy1.png` - Initial Form background
- [ ] `puffy2.png` - Diet Form background
- [ ] `puffy3.png` - Song Form background
- [ ] `puffy4.png` - Message Form background

## Implementation Strategy

### CSS/Styling Approach
- Use `background-image` CSS property
- Implement `background-size: cover` for responsive scaling
- Add subtle overlay for text readability if needed
- Maintain consistent positioning and transitions

### Code Structure
- Create character-specific background mappings
- Implement step-based background switching
- Ensure backgrounds match character themes
- Maintain existing form functionality

### Style Guidelines for Uniformity
- **Background opacity/overlay**: Consistent across all characters
- **Text readability**: Ensure forms remain legible
- **Transition effects**: Smooth background changes between steps
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Images scale appropriately
- **Performance**: Optimize image sizes for web
